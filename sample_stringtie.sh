# Now we will run the program stringtie, which will use our alignments (the sorted .bam files) to estimate expression levels for each gene in our genome

# The -p flag tells the program to run on 8 threads
# -e tells stringtie to operate in expression estimation mode, limiting the processing of read alignments to estimating the coverage of transcripts given in the -G option
# -G allows you to specify a gff file containing annotation information for the genome you mapped your reads to
# -B specifies the output format of tables containing coverage data for the reference transcripts in the GFF file
